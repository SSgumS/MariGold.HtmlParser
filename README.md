##MariGold.HtmlParser
MariGold.HtmlParser is a utility to parse the HTML documents into a collection of `IHtmlNode` type instances. You can either traverse through the document by parsing every root element one by one or parse the entire document at once. Once an HTML element parsed, it will recursively parse all the child elements.
